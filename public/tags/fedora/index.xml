      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using this blog as a log of troubleshooting steps I&amp;rsquo;ve done before, so I don&amp;rsquo;t waste my time the next time I nuke my computer and try again.

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard by now about the impending nonsense coming to those of us still living in Windows land. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t, let me give you a few of the particular annoyances I&amp;rsquo;ve got with the 2024 planned changes:&#xA;AI incorporation into all aspects of the OS. Source Capturing every aspect of your computer, Source despite all the possible concerns associated with that idea. Source Even more advertising throughout the OS.</description>
