      <description>Today I had a Hal with the Light Bulb moment.&#xA;The Switch Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Work I wanted to install a new package into Neovim so I could mess around with Neorg, an org-mode-like plugin. I want to try to get better at organizing myself and actually get working on creating things I want to do. The impetus for Neorg was a desire to start working on scripts for a podcast idea: &amp;ldquo;Uninteresting Stories to Induce Sleep.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m fairly confident I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;m generally incompetent when it comes to the core competencies of a programmer. I am still learning the terminology for concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past like language formatting and completion in an IDE, while deploying them in my preferred &amp;ldquo;IDE&amp;rdquo; of choice, which is Neovim these days. Perhaps, as I continue this project of learning and writing about learing through this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll bother to figure out how to properly use things like nvim-lsp and mason.</description>
