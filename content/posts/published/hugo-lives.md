## A New Venue for My Learning

I've had this webspace for nearly a year and I've done absolutely nothing with it. No longer! I was motivated briefly to update my domain on bluesky, but I had not added anything to this website. So I decided to start diving into static website generators like I had wanted to for a long while. 

I initially started with Pelican, but I got annoyed with the limited documentation on how to get the theme to actually play nice with my webhosts insistence that all files go into the "public_html" folder. I could have done something different, rather than use the built in file uploader, but I didn't want to get too fancy.

Then I remembered I bought a book ages ago about Hugo and I had barely touched the thing. Well, this was a great opportunity to try diving back in. Thankfully, the hugo quickstart documentation is excellent, with well written instructions on how to get files uploaded to your server. While I did have to poke around until I discovered how to properly upload files with rclone, it went much faster and much smoother than Pelican. 

And so, this will be my first post of very few on this website, which I hope to fully develop using Hugo. Of course, I'll write my posts through a terminal using my lovely, customized NVIM setup that I almost barely understand, but what is the joy of life if not learning new things. Much like the joy of being an American is barreling ahead with a little knowledge and hoping for the best. 

In any event, I'm sure hoping for the best.
